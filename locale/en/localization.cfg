think-story-1=Everyone okay? We crash-landed, and are now stranded here.
think-story-2=What do you mean stranded? Can't we just fix the ship and head back?
think-story-3=I wish it were that simple. But the damage is extensive. We should set up a base here.
think-story-4=I found some resources to build a town hall. If you can't find us, have a look at the map. It's a bit cramped here though. Let's build some houses!
think-story-5=Hey Engineer! Can you get us some stone to build houses? There are some nice rocks nearby.
think-story-6=Thank you! Now we can put up some new houses. Have a look at what we're building!
think-story-7=Phew, that was some heavy construction. Time for lunch!
think-story-8=If you're not hungry, you can start gathering some iron plates and stones. We need to build more robust houses.
think-story-9=Great job! We'll get right to work. Let's see how much we can build with the new resources.
think-story-10=The workers are getting thirsty and need water. Build an offshore pump and pipes to the storage tank next to the town hall.
think-story-11=So refreshing! Now we can work even harder.
think-story-12=Work reminds me of dinner. And we already ate all our food. Help!
think-story-13=Don't worry! With the resources we received we built an apple farm in the south.
think-story-14=Engineer, would you supply the farm with water and power so it can grow apples?
think-story-15=Great work! Now please bring those apples to the market.
think-story-16=Those apples are tasty! Yum!
think-story-17=Crew member, did you pay for them?
think-story-18=Yes! The money is in the treasury. It should be somewhere in the city.
think-story-19=Enginner, we can use the money to fund research. Let's start by building a university and placing it near the city.
think-story-20=Great! Now that we have a university, you can supply it with currency and fund some reasearch.
think-story-21=We can further grow the city to fund even more research. The possibilities are endless!
think-story-ending=This concludes the story. Thank you for playing! You can continue playing if you like, but there's no more story.
